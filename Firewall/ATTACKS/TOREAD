In order to run attacks for showing the beauty of this project, Please do the following:
First, DOWNLOAD scapy as `sudo pip install scapy`

Then, run every attack without the module to show that the PC is unsafe!

And foreach Component:

Firewall:
	Run the module like that (change the ip to prevent from, and NOTICE the ., at the end!):
		sudo insmod fw.ko blacklist_string_arg="192.168.43.129.," bl_len=16 
	From another computer just:
		sudo ./firewall.py

DOS:
	Run the module with this string:
		sudo insmod fw.ko features_string_arg="D" fe_len=1
	From another computer just:
		sudo ./DOS.py

ARP_SPOOFING:
	****  For showing the beauty of arp_spoofing, after running the attack, sniff data through Wireshark and from the victim enter a site and show that in Wireshark.
	Then, do the same with the SecureMyTux and show that now the computer is safe.
	****

        Run the module with this string:
                sudo insmod fw.ko features_string_arg="A" fe_len=1
        From another computer just:
                sudo ./arp_spoofing.py

Rogue_DHCP:
	Run the module with this string:
		sudo insmod fw.ko features_string_arg="R" fe_len=1 dhcp_server_ip_arg="192.168.43.1" server_len=12 #USE WIRESHARK TO DEBUG
	From another computer just:
		sudo ./rogue_dhcp.py
